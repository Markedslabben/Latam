# Task ID: 2
# Title: Calculate Volume-Weighted Prices for Wind Power
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement calculation of volume-weighted prices for wind power production to evaluate its production profile value.
# Details:
1. Use the existing sim_res_df and result datasets containing 11 years of hourly wind turbine data
2. For each hour, multiply the electricity price by wind power production
3. Sum these products for all hours in each year
4. Divide by the total wind production for the respective year
5. Create functions to perform this calculation for different time periods (yearly, monthly, etc.)
6. Store results in a structured format for comparison and visualization

# Test Strategy:
Validate calculations with manual checks for sample periods. Ensure the weighted average makes mathematical sense (falls within the range of observed prices).
