# Task ID: 8
# Title: Integrate Battery Model with Existing Simulation Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Connect the battery optimization model with the existing wind and solar simulation framework for comprehensive analysis.
# Details:
1. Create interfaces between the battery model and existing simulation components
2. Ensure data formats are compatible across all modules
3. Implement a sequential process flow that passes PV production to the battery model
4. Combine the outputs from wind, solar, and battery models into a unified results structure
5. Ensure the integrated model preserves all constraints and assumptions
6. Optimize the data flow to minimize memory usage with large datasets

# Test Strategy:
Run end-to-end simulations and verify that results from each component are correctly passed to subsequent components. Check that the final output includes contributions from all sources.
