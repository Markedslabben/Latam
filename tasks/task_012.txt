Task_description 12

use pvlib to creat a function  that calculats the hourly PV production of 1 kWp solar PV at location lat,lon, az, tilt and a specified PV module.  
I am not sure we need to provide inverter type.  I know pvlib has access to libraries for PV panels, and has functionality to use the API of PVGIS from which we will get the production estimat

For testing, make sure that the resulta are reasonable, we expcect about 1800-1600  kWh/kWp as aresult, and we want hourly values from 2024-01-01 00:00 to 2024-12-31 23:59, but you should use the represenative year option for acquiring data from PVGIS. This means it is a representative year, and the 2024 irradiation data is anyhow not available
theresults shoudl be in th form of a dataframe with first column time (column name ) and second column the kWh/kWp.
