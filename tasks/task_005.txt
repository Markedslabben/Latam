# Task ID: 5
# Title: Review and Enhance pv_battery_lp.py
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Review the existing battery dispatch optimization code and ensure it meets the requirements for the battery storage simulation.
# Details:
1. Review the existing pv_battery_lp.py implementation
2. Verify it correctly handles the constraint that batteries can only store energy from PV (not grid)
3. Check that it properly models 4-hour duration batteries
4. Ensure the optimization objective is correctly defined (likely maximizing revenue)
5. Validate the mathematical formulation of the linear program
6. Document the model's assumptions and limitations

# Test Strategy:
Run the model with simplified test cases where the optimal solution can be manually verified. Check boundary conditions and extreme scenarios.
