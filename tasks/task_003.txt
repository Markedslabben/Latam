# Task ID: 3
# Title: Calculate Volume-Weighted Prices for Solar PV
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement calculation of volume-weighted prices for solar PV production to evaluate its production profile value.
# Details:
1. Use the same approach as for wind power but with solar PV production data
2. For each hour, multiply the electricity price by solar PV production
3. Sum these products for all hours in each year
4. Divide by the total solar PV production for the respective year
5. Create functions to perform this calculation for different time periods (yearly, monthly, etc.)
6. Store results in a structured format for comparison and visualization

# Test Strategy:
Validate calculations with manual checks for sample periods. Compare with wind results to ensure the methodology is consistent.
