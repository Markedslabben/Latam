Additional tasks is as follows:  

1. the turbine shading for the pvgis that only includes the turbine tower has been expanded in later attempts to include also 
rotor flicker area. By includin the shading from the whole rotor swpt area, it would then be possible to account for all of the shading


2. I have now the results sim_res_df and result which is wind turbine aggregated results for all hours over 11 years.  I want to calculate the 
revenues from wind and solar respectively, and calculate each of those sources volume weighted prices defined as : 
 (price(t) x production_wind_power(t))/production(t) at time t for summed over all hours of the year.  Same procedure for solar pv
These volume weighted prices should indicate whether wind and solar has favorable production profiles

3. there is a requirement of 50% of PV installed capacity of battery storage, which can last 4 hours. 
   Now for a realistic assessment of its value, then we should make a simulation of optimized use of the battery storage as follows: 

   For a given known price of electricity t, t = 1..8760 , and known production of solar pv at time t
dispatch of batteries. It is not possible to import from the grid, we  can only store from the PV and discharge to the grid.
