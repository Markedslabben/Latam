Connect to the PVGIS API to retrieve TMY (Typical Meteorological Year) data for the specified location\n3. Process the retrieved data to extract relevant solar irradiance and temperature information\n4. Allow selection from common PV module types or custom module parameters\n5. Calculate solar position for each hour using pvlib's solar position algorithms\n6. Determine plane-of-array irradiance based on the system orientation\n7. Model PV cell temperature based on ambient conditions and module characteristics\n8. Calculate DC and AC power production for each hour accounting for all relevant losses\n9. Convert power to energy (kWh) and normalize to per kWp\n10. Return a well-structured DataFrame with datetime index and hourly production values\n\nThe implementation should target an annual production of 1600-1800 kWh/kWp for typical European locations with optimal orientation.

Integration tests:\n   - Compare results against PVGIS web calculator output for the same parameters\n   - Verify API connection and data retrieval works correctly\n   - Test with different module types and system configurations\n\n3. Validation tests:\n   - Verify annual production falls within 1600-1800 kWh/kWp for optimal configurations in European locations\n   - Check seasonal patterns match expected solar resource distribution\n   - Validate hourly profiles against typical production curves\n\n4. Performance tests:\n   - Measure execution time for multiple location calculations\n   - Test caching mechanisms if implemented\n\nCreate a test suite with at least 5 reference locations across different climate zones and compare results with PVGIS web interface outputs.
