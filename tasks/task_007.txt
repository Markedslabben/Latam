# Task ID: 7
# Title: Optimize Battery Dispatch Algorithm
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the battery dispatch optimization to maximize revenue based on electricity prices and PV production.
# Details:
1. Implement a linear programming model for battery dispatch optimization
2. Use hourly electricity prices and PV production as inputs
3. Define the objective function to maximize revenue
4. Implement constraints for battery state of charge, charging/discharging rates
5. Ensure the model respects the 4-hour duration limitation
6. Optimize the algorithm for computational efficiency with large datasets

# Test Strategy:
Test with historical price and production data. Verify that the battery charges during low-price periods with PV production and discharges during high-price periods. Check that total energy constraints are respected.
