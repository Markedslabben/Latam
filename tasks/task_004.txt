# Task ID: 4
# Title: Compare Wind and Solar Production Profiles
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Analyze and compare the volume-weighted prices of wind and solar to determine which has more favorable production profiles.
# Details:
1. Create a comparative analysis framework for the volume-weighted prices
2. Calculate the difference between volume-weighted prices and average market prices for both sources
3. Identify periods where each source performs better relative to market prices
4. Generate statistical measures (mean, median, variance) for both sources
5. Implement visualization tools to illustrate the differences
6. Document findings regarding which source has more favorable production timing

# Test Strategy:
Verify that comparisons are statistically sound. Use sensitivity analysis to ensure conclusions are robust across different time periods.
