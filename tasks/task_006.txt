# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement 50% PV Capacity Battery Storage Requirement
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the battery optimization model to enforce the requirement that battery capacity must be 50% of PV installed capacity with 4-hour duration.
# Details:
1. Update the battery model to automatically size battery capacity as 50% of PV capacity
2. Ensure the energy capacity is set to 4 times the power capacity (4-hour duration)
3. Implement constraints to prevent grid charging
4. Verify that the battery can only charge from excess PV production
5. Include efficiency losses in the battery charge/discharge cycle
6. Add parameters for battery degradation if applicable

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the battery capacity scales correctly with different PV system sizes. Check that energy and power constraints are properly enforced in the optimization results.
