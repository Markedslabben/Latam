# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Turbine Shading with Rotor Flicker Area
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Expand the existing turbine shading model in PVGIS to include the full rotor swept area, not just the tower.
# Details:
1. Review the current implementation that only accounts for tower shading
2. Develop a geometric model for the rotor swept area based on turbine specifications
3. Calculate shadow projection of the full rotor area based on sun position
4. Integrate the expanded shadow model into the existing PVGIS calculation framework
5. Ensure the model accounts for different times of day and seasons

# Test Strategy:
Compare results with and without rotor flicker to validate the difference. Verify against any available empirical data or industry standards for wind turbine shading effects.
