# Title: Calculate Combined System Revenue and Economics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop analysis tools to calculate total system revenue and economic metrics with the addition of battery storage.
# Details:
1. Calculate total revenue from wind, solar PV, and battery operations
2. Implement metrics such as IRR, NPV, and payback period
3. Calculate the incremental value added by the battery system
4. Compare economics with and without battery storage
5. Analyze sensitivity to key parameters (electricity prices, battery costs, etc.)
6. Create summary statistics and key performance indicators

# Test Strategy:
Validate economic calculations against standard financial models. Perform sensitivity analysis to ensure the model responds appropriately to parameter changes.
