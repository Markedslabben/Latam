# Latam Wind & Solar Hybrid Project – Project Report (Draft)

## 1. Executive Summary
This report summarizes the assessment and design of a hybrid wind and solar power project for the Latam site. The project includes wind resource evaluation, preliminary turbine layout, production estimates, solar PV compatibility mapping, and a hybrid system overview. The work follows the agreed scope and deliverables as outlined in the project task list.

## 2. Project Background and Objectives
The Latam site has been identified as a promising location for a hybrid renewable energy project, combining wind and solar power. The main objectives are:
- To assess wind and solar resources at the site.
- To develop a preliminary layout for wind turbines and compatible solar PV zones.
- To estimate annual energy production and revenues.
- To provide a hybrid system overview, including BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) considerations.

## 3. Site Description
The project area is characterized by:
- Sufficient land area for both wind turbines and solar PV installations.
- Favorable topography for wind energy, with minimal wake effects and straightforward layout optimization.
- Accessibility for construction, including roads and crane pads.
- Grid connection potential, with consideration for substation placement and grid limitations.

## 4. Wind Resource Assessment and Turbine Layout

### 4.1 Digital Terrain Model (DTM)
A digital terrain model was obtained to support wind flow modeling and layout planning.

### 4.2 Virtual Wind Data and Production Estimates
Several approaches were considered for wind resource assessment:
- **Option A:** ERA5 hourly data (31 km resolution, 100m hub height). High uncertainty (~22.5%).
- **Option B:** Vortex Mast service (downscaled to 100m, 17% uncertainty). This option was selected and ordered.
- **Option C:** ERA5 + CFD modeling for distributed wind field (17% uncertainty, higher cost).
- **Option D:** Vortex + CFD (12% uncertainty, highest cost, not pursued due to lack of measurement campaign).

### 4.3 Wind Statistics and Global Atlas Comparison
Wind statistics were compared with global wind atlas data to validate the resource assessment.

### 4.4 Turbine Layout
- GIS mapping and terrain boundaries were prepared.
- The layout was optimized for the site's shape and minimal wake effects.
- The selected turbine is the Nordex 6.x series, with power curves obtained via industry contacts.

## 5. Wind Production and Revenue Estimates

### 5.1 Hourly Production Estimate
- Hourly wind production was estimated using the selected wind resource data and turbine layout.
- Wake losses were included in the P50 production estimate.

### 5.2 Hourly Price Data and Revenue
- Representative hourly price data was provided by DE Latam.
- Hourly revenues were calculated based on production and price data.

## 6. Solar PV Compatibility Mapping

### 6.1 Infrastructure and Access
- Roads and access infrastructure for turbines and crane pads were mapped.
- Substation placement (690V/22kV) and auxiliary consumption (1–1.5%) were considered.

### 6.2 PV Zone Definition
- GIS-based analysis was performed to define viable PV zones within the site.
- Shading from turbines was projected onto a solar irradiation map to identify exclusion areas.
- The analysis was handed over to the solar specialist (Anna) for further refinement.

## 7. Hybrid System Overview

### 7.1 Combined Layout
- A hybrid system layout was developed, integrating wind turbines, PV blocks, BESS, and substation.

### 7.2 BESS Dimensioning and Production Estimate
- An overall production estimate was made, including BESS sizing considerations.
- The tradeoff between storage cost per MWh and operational constraints was analyzed.
- BESS costs and grid constraints were sourced from DE Latam.

| D        | 12             | 5,100    | 5,865           |              |

- **Selected Option:** Option B (Vortex Mast service) was chosen for its balance of cost and uncertainty.

## 9. Key Results and Conclusions

- **Wind Production:** Estimated annual wind energy production is 180 GWh for a 50 MW wind farm.
- **Solar Potential:** The site can accommodate up to 132 MW of solar PV (approx. 200 GWh/year), subject to grid limitations.
- **Hybrid Design:** The combined wind and solar layout, with BESS, maximizes site utilization and revenue potential.
- **Uncertainty:** The selected wind resource assessment method (Vortex Mast) provides a reasonable uncertainty (17%) for early-stage project development.

## 10. Next Steps and Recommendations

- Finalize detailed design and confirm grid connection capacity.
- Refine solar PV layout and shading analysis.
- Conduct further BESS optimization if required.
- Consider on-site measurement campaign for further uncertainty reduction if project advances to later stages.
