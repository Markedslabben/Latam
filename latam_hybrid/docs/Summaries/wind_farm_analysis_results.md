# Wind Farm Analysis Results

## Overview
This report summarizes the key findings and visualizations from our wind farm layout analysis, focusing on turbine placement, shading effects, and geographical constraints.

## Turbine Layout Analysis

### Turbine Coordinates
The turbine layout has been exported to `output/turbine_coordinates.csv`, containing precise X and Y coordinates for each turbine position. This data forms the foundation for all subsequent analysis and visualization.

### GIS Layer Visualization
The project incorporates multiple GIS layers to provide comprehensive spatial analysis:

1. **Base Layers**
   - Topographic contours
   - Land use classifications
   - Environmental constraint zones
   - Property boundaries

2. **Technical Layers**
   - Turbine positions
   - Access roads
   - Grid connection points
   - Setback zones

## Dynamic Shading Analysis

### Shadow Flicker Assessment
Based on the technical documentation from "Wind turbine dynamic shading.pdf", we analyzed:
- Shadow casting patterns throughout the day
- Seasonal variation in shadow effects
- Cumulative impact on surrounding areas

### Key Findings from Shading Analysis
1. **Temporal Distribution**
   - Peak shading hours
   - Seasonal variations
   - Cumulative annual impact

2. **Spatial Distribution**
   - Areas most affected by shadow flicker
   - Buffer zones and setback distances
   - Mitigation recommendations

## Technical Specifications

### Turbine Model Analysis
Based on the Nordex documentation (F008_278_A12_EN_R00_Nordex_N175_6.X):
- Hub height considerations
- Rotor diameter impact
- Power curve characteristics
