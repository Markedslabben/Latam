## Critical Findings

### 1. Hub Height Matters Significantly
- **145m vs 125m:** 5.2-8.4% production difference
- Lower hub heights experience substantially reduced wind speeds
- Economic analysis must account for this trade-off

### 2. FLH Requirement Changes Viable Options
**Previously viable (uncorrected):**
- N164 @ 164m, V162-6.2 @ 145m, V162-6.2 @ 125m, V163-4.5 @ 145m, V163-4.5 @ 125m

**Now viable (corrected):**
- V162-6.2 @ 145m, V163-4.5 @ 145m, V163-4.5 @ 125m

**Impact:**
- N164 @ 164m: Still below threshold
- **V162-6.2 @ 125m: NOW FAILS** (2,863 FLH < 3,000)

### 3. Recommended Configuration
**Vestas V162-6.2 @ 145m** emerges as the optimal choice:
- Highest production among viable options (243.4 GWh/yr)
- Meets FLH requirement (3,019 FLH > 3,000)
- 15.8% higher production than V163-4.5 @ 145m
- 145m hub height provides good wind resource without excessive tower cost

```
⚠️ CRITICAL UPDATE: Wind Shear Corrections Applied

This analysis incorporates wind shear corrections for turbine configurations
at different hub heights. Previous versions used uncorrected 164m wind speeds
for all configurations, leading to overestimated production for lower hub heights.
```

## Next Steps (Recommended)

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review corrected results** in power_curve_analysis.md
2. **Update project presentations** with new production values
3. **Revise economic models** based on corrected energy yields

### Technical Validation
1. **Run verification script:**
   ```bash
   python PowerCurve_analysis/scripts/verify_wind_shear_correction.py
   ```
2. **Compare with manufacturer estimates** for validation
3. **Consider measurement campaign** at 125m, 145m, 164m for final validation

### Economic Analysis
1. **Focus on three viable configurations:**
   - V162-6.2 @ 145m (highest production)
   - V163-4.5 @ 145m (highest FLH)
   - V163-4.5 @ 125m (lower production but viable)
2. **Obtain CAPEX/OPEX quotes** for these configurations
3. **Calculate LCOE** for final selection decision
