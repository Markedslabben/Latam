# Executive Summary (HOVEDBUDSKAP)

Based on 11-year timeseries PyWake simulations with comprehensive loss modeling and **wind shear corrections**, five turbine configurations were evaluated for the 13-turbine wind farm. The **Nordex N164 (7.0 MW) @ 164m** delivers the highest absolute production at **253.3 GWh/yr** with 2,783 full load hours, but falls below the 3,000 FLH viability threshold. The **Vestas V162-6.2 @ 145m** produces **243.4 GWh/yr** (3,019 FLH), representing **15.8% higher production** than the 4.5 MW alternative at the same hub height and **exceeding the 3,000 FLH requirement**. The **Vestas V163-4.5 @ 145m** achieves the highest capacity factor (41.0%, 3,593 FLH) with 210.2 GWh/yr. Hub height significantly impacts production: 125m configurations show 5-9% lower yields than 145m equivalents due to reduced wind speeds at lower heights. Total losses are consistent across configurations (20.8-21.7%), validating the simulation methodology. **Critical correction:** Wind speeds are now properly adjusted for each hub height using validated wind shear coefficients (α=0.1846).

| Configuration | Rated Power (MW) | Hub Height (m) | Net AEP (GWh/yr) | Total Loss (%) | CF (%) | FLH (hr/yr) | Norm. Production | V6.2-V4.5 Delta |
|---------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|--------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Nordex N164 @ 164m | 7.0 | 164 | 253.3 | 21.4 | 31.8 | 2,783 | 1.20 | N/A |
| V162-6.2 @ 145m | 6.2 | 145 | 243.4 | 21.4 | 34.5 | 3,019 | 1.16 | +15.8% |
| V163-4.5 @ 145m | 4.5 | 145 | 210.2 | 20.8 | 41.0 | 3,593 | 1.00 | (ref) |

| V163-4.5 @ 125m | 4.5 | 125 | 201.8 | 21.0 | 39.4 | 3,450 | 0.96 | (ref) |

*Note: Normalized Production uses V163-4.5 @ 145m as reference (1.00). V6.2-V4.5 Delta shows percentage production advantage of 6.2 MW over 4.5 MW at same hub height. All configurations use wind shear-corrected wind speeds appropriate for their hub heights.*

## 1.2 PyWake Simulation Results with Comprehensive Losses (11-Year Average, Wind Shear Corrected)

Hourly timeseries simulations using PyWake's Bastankhah-Gaussian wake model with 13-turbine layout and **wind shear-corrected time series** for each hub height:

| Configuration | Net AEP (GWh/yr) | CF (%) | Wake Loss (%) | Sector Loss (%) | Other Loss (%) | Total Loss (%) | Wind Correction |
|---------------|------------------|--------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Nordex N164 @ 164m | 253.3 | 31.8 | 9.5 | 4.6 | 7.3 | 21.4 | None (reference) |
| V162-6.2 @ 145m | 243.4 | 34.5 | 9.5 | 4.6 | 7.3 | 21.4 | -2.3% WS |
| V163-4.5 @ 145m | 210.2 | 41.0 | 8.3 | 5.1 | 7.4 | 20.8 | -2.3% WS |
| V162-6.2 @ 125m | 230.8 | 32.7 | 9.9 | 4.5 | 7.3 | 21.7 | -4.9% WS |
| V163-4.5 @ 125m | 201.8 | 39.4 | 8.7 | 5.0 | 7.3 | 21.0 | -4.9% WS |

## 1.4 Sector Management and Wind Directional Distribution

The wind rose reveals directional distribution at the site, which directly impacts sector management strategy and turbine layout optimization.

![Wind Rose: Directional Distribution with Sector Management](figures/validation_wind_rose.png)

*Figure 1.4: Wind rose showing dominant directions (East-Northeast 60-90° and Southeast 120-150°). Prohibited sectors [60°-120°] and [240°-300°] shown as shaded regions.*

**Sector Management Strategy:**

Operational restrictions apply in two directional sectors totaling 120° (33% of directional range): [60°-120°] and [240°-300°]. These sectors are prohibited to minimize wake interactions between turbines in the closely-spaced 13-turbine layout. Sector management is implemented on alternating turbines (every second turbine), avoiding wake interaction and increasing effective spacing between active wakes. This approach enables the dense turbine spacing while limiting wake losses to 8-10%, resulting in 4.6-5.2% production sacrifice but enabling higher farm density than would otherwise be achievable.

# 2. Recommendations

The Vestas V162-6.2 @ 145m configuration is recommended for this project. This turbine delivers 243.4 GWh/yr (highest viable production), exceeds the 3,000 FLH requirement (3,019 FLH), and provides 15.8% more energy than the 4.5 MW alternative at the same hub height. Hub height selection proves critical: 145m configurations outperform 125m equivalents by 5-9% due to higher wind speeds at elevation. The Nordex N164, despite highest absolute production (253.3 GWh/yr), fails the FLH threshold at 2,783 hours. Economic analysis should focus on the three FLH-compliant configurations (V162-6.2 @ 145m, V163-4.5 @ 145m, V163-4.5 @ 125m) with LCOE comparison determining final selection. Wind shear corrections have been applied using validated power law extrapolation (α=0.1846, R²=0.9995), ensuring realistic production estimates for each hub height. All results based on 11-year PyWake simulations (2010-2021, 99,000 hourly timesteps) with Bastankhah-Gaussian wake model and comprehensive loss accounting (wake 8-10%, sector management 4.6-5.2%, other 7.3%).

---

# 3. Methodology

## 3.1 PyWake Simulation Framework

Energy yield simulations employed PyWake 2.4+ (DTU Wind Energy), an industry-standard open-source framework. Hourly timeseries simulations covered 99,000 timesteps (11.3 years, 2010-2021) using Vortex ERA5 wind data at 164m reference height.

## 3.2 Wake Model

Bastankhah-Gaussian wake deficit model was applied throughout. This industry-standard approach uses Gaussian velocity profiles with turbulence intensity-dependent wake expansion, providing superior accuracy compared to older Jensen/NOJ models. See PyWake documentation (DTU Wind Energy) for model specifications.

## 3.3 Loss Categories

Total losses (20.8-21.7%) comprise three components: (1) Wake losses (8-10%) from upstream turbine interference calculated by PyWake, (2) Sector management losses (4.6-5.2%) from operational restrictions in prohibited directions [60°-120°] and [240°-300°], and (3) Other losses (7.3%) including electrical systems, availability, and environmental effects. Consistent total loss percentages across configurations validate simulation robustness.

## 3.4 Wind Shear Correction

Height-specific wind speed corrections applied power law extrapolation V(h) = V_ref × (h/h_ref)^α with α=0.1846 (Global Wind Atlas, R²=0.9995). Corrections transform 164m reference wind speeds to realistic values for 145m (factor 0.9775, -2.3% wind speed) and 125m (factor 0.9511, -4.9% wind speed) hub heights. Corrections applied to entire timeseries before PyWake simulation, preserving temporal patterns while adjusting magnitude. Detailed correction factors documented in Appendix A.

## 3.5 Turbine Layout

Thirteen turbines arranged with 3-5 rotor diameter spacing, optimized to minimize downstream positioning in dominant East-Northeast and Southeast wind corridors. Moderately dense spacing (wake losses 8-10%) reflects land use constraints while maintaining production efficiency.

## 3.6 Flow Modeling

No CFD or WAsP flow modeling applied due to flat terrain (<5m elevation change) and absence of calibration data (no met mast or LiDAR). Homogeneous flow assumption provides conservative estimates appropriate for preliminary analysis. Future refinement recommended if physical measurements become available.

## 3.7 Data Source

Vortex ERA5 mesoscale reanalysis provided hourly wind data (164m hub height, 11.3 years 2010-2021). ERA5 offers 99,000 hourly records enabling high-fidelity timeseries simulations capturing seasonal patterns, diurnal cycles, and extreme events. Location: Dominican Republic (19.72°N, 71.36°W).

# APPENDICES

## Appendix A: Site Wind Resource Characterization (BEVISFØRING - Supporting Evidence)

### Wind Speed Distribution

The 11.3-year dataset reveals robust wind resource at 164m hub height:

- **Mean wind speed:** 7.35 m/s
- **Weibull scale parameter (A):** 8.27 m/s
- **Weibull shape parameter (k):** 2.23
- **Data coverage:** 99,000 hourly records (2013-12-31 to 2025-04-17)

The excellent Weibull fit (0.33% deviation between measured and theoretical mean) validates parametric methods for long-term predictions. Shape parameter k=2.23 indicates moderate variability, typical of trade wind influenced Caribbean sites.

![Figure 1: Wind Speed Distribution and Power Curves](figures/figure1_wind_distribution_power_curves.png)

### Directional Distribution

Wind rose analysis shows strong directional preferences:

![Figure 2: Wind Rose - Directional Distribution](figures/validation_wind_rose.png)

- **Dominant sectors:** 60-120° (E-ESE) and 240-300° (WSW-W)
- **Operational sector retention:** 70.2% of all hourly records
- **Mean wind speed in allowed sectors:** 8.14 m/s (vs 7.35 m/s omni-directional)

This 10.7% higher wind speed in operational sectors explains why sector losses (4.6-5.2%) are relatively modest despite 29.8% time exclusion.

### Hub Height Adjustment and Wind Shear Correction

**Power law wind shear:** α = 0.1846 (calculated from Global Wind Atlas data)

![Wind Shear Profile with Power Law Fit](wind_shear_alpha.png)

*Figure: Wind shear coefficient determination using power law regression. Left panel shows wind speed vs height with fitted power law curve (α=0.1846). Right panel shows log-log linearization demonstrating excellent fit (R²=0.9995). Data points from Global Wind Atlas at 50m, 100m, 150m, and 200m heights.*

**Wind Speed at Different Hub Heights (Wind Shear Corrected)**

| Hub Height (m) | Correction Factor | Mean Wind Speed (m/s) | Change from 164m | Configuration Application |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **164** (reference) | 1.0000 | 7.35 | - | Nordex N164 @ 164m |
| 145 | 0.9775 | 7.18 | -2.3% | Vestas V162-6.2 & V163-4.5 @ 145m |
| 125 | 0.9511 | 6.99 | -4.9% | Vestas V162-6.2 & V163-4.5 @ 125m |
| 100 (reference) | 0.9127 | 6.71 | -8.7% | Not used in this analysis |
| 80 | 0.8759 | 6.44 | -12.4% | Not used in this analysis |
| 50 | 0.8031 | 5.90 | -19.7% | Not used in this analysis |

**Power Law Formula:** V(h) = V_ref × (h / h_ref)^α

Where:
- V_ref = Wind speed at reference height (164m) = 7.35 m/s
- h = Target hub height (meters)
- h_ref = Reference height = 164m
- α = Wind shear exponent = 0.1846

**Shear Coefficient Validation:**

The shear exponent α = 0.1846 was derived using least-squares regression on Global Wind Atlas data at multiple heights (50m, 100m, 150m, 200m). The power law fit achieved R² = 0.9995, indicating excellent agreement across the 50-200m range. This validates high confidence for extrapolation within the 125-164m hub height range used in this analysis.

**Implementation Details:**

Wind speed time series corrections are applied BEFORE PyWake simulation input, ensuring each turbine configuration experiences wind speeds appropriate for its hub height. The correction is applied to the entire hourly time series (99,000 records), maintaining temporal patterns (seasonal variations, diurnal cycles, weather events) while adjusting absolute wind speed magnitudes.

**Impact on Energy Yield:**

The cubic relationship between wind speed and power (P ∝ V³) amplifies the effect of wind speed reductions:
- 2.3% wind speed reduction (145m) → approximately 7% energy reduction
- 4.9% wind speed reduction (125m) → approximately 14% energy reduction

This explains why hub height selection has such significant impact on energy production and project economics.

## Appendix B: PyWake Simulation Methodology (BEVISFØRING)

PyWake 2.4+ (DTU Wind Energy) provided energy yield simulations using the Bastankhah-Gaussian wake model, validated for offshore and flat terrain applications by Ørsted, Vattenfall, and DTU Wind Energy. The model employs physically-based Gaussian velocity deficits capturing wake expansion, turbulence effects, and multiple wake interactions. Timeseries simulations processed 99,000 hourly records (2010-2021) across the 13-turbine layout with blockage effects and default turbulence modeling.

### Loss Calculation Sequence

| Step | Loss Type | Method | Nordex N164 Example |
|------|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | Ideal Production | Power curve applied to wind speeds | 322.3 GWh/yr (Gross AEP) |
| 2 | Wake Losses | PyWake velocity deficits reduce wind speed | -30.6 GWh/yr (-9.5%) |
| 3 | Sector Management | Prohibited directions [60°-120°, 240°-300°] | -14.9 GWh/yr (-4.6%) |
| 4 | Other Losses | Electrical (3%) + Availability (2%) + Degradation (1%) + Curtailment (1.5%) | -23.6 GWh/yr (-7.3%) |
| **Final** | **Net Production** | **Sum of losses applied sequentially** | **253.3 GWh/yr** |

*Note: Wake-sector interaction approximation introduces ~0.5-1% uncertainty.*

### Validation Results

Cross-validation against 2020 single-year analysis confirmed simulation robustness: 11-year average (253.3 GWh/yr) vs 2020 (+3.2% to 261.5 GWh/yr) falls within normal ±3-5% inter-annual variability. Wake losses remained consistent (9.5% vs 9.3%), while sector losses showed expected directional variability (4.6% vs 5.3%). Per-turbine production summations match farm totals, loss percentages calculate correctly, and capacity factors (25-45%) remain within physical bounds for all configurations.

## Appendix F: Wind Statistics Summary

**Dataset:** vortex.serie.850689.10y 164m UTC-04.0 ERA5.txt

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total records | 99,000 hours |
| Period | 2013-12-31 to 2025-04-17 |
| Duration | 11.3 years |
| Mean wind speed | 7.35 m/s |
| Standard deviation | 3.42 m/s |
| Maximum wind speed | 23.8 m/s |
| Minimum wind speed | 0.1 m/s |

| Weibull k | 2.226 |
| Weibull mean | 7.326 m/s |
| Fit error | 0.33% |

## Appendix D: Sector Management Analysis

**Allowed operational sectors:** 60-120° and 240-300°

| Metric | All Directions | Allowed Sectors Only | Difference |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|------------|
| Records | 99,000 | 69,467 | 70.2% retained |
| Mean wind speed | 7.35 m/s | 8.14 m/s | +10.7% |
| Weibull A | 8.27 m/s | 9.16 m/s | +10.8% |
| Weibull k | 2.226 | 2.189 | -1.7% |

**Interpretation:** The 10.7% higher wind speed in operational sectors explains why sector management losses (4.6-5.2%) are modest despite excluding 29.8% of time. Prohibited sectors (0-60°, 120-240°, 300-360°) experience significantly lower wind speeds, likely due to local terrain or atmospheric effects.

![Four-Panel Comparison: Per-Turbine Production and Losses](figures/per_turbine_comparison_4panel.png)

**Cross-Configuration Observations:**
- **Wake pattern consistency:** Turbines 7-9 experience highest wake losses across all configurations (layout-dependent effect)
- **Sector loss uniformity:** Same turbines affected by sector management regardless of turbine type (site-specific constraint)
- **Turbine size effect:** Smaller turbines (V163-4.5) show better wake recovery, benefiting downstream positions
- **Production spread:** 1.5x variation from lowest to highest producing turbine within each configuration

## A.2 Individual Configuration Details

### A.2.1 Nordex N164 @ 164m - Per-Turbine Breakdown

![Per-Turbine: Nordex N164 @ 164m](figures/per_turbine_Nordex_N164_164m.png)

**Key observations:**
- **Highest wake losses:** Turbines 7-9 show 20-28% wake loss (5-7 GWh/yr lost) - downstream positions in dominant wind direction
- **Sector management impact:** Turbines 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12 lose 10-11% to sector restrictions (2.0-2.7 GWh/yr) - layout positions near prohibited sectors
- **Best performers:** Turbines 2, 11, 13 achieve >21 GWh/yr net production with minimal wake interference
- **Production variation:** 1.5x spread from 15.1 GWh/yr (T9, heavily waked) to 22.6 GWh/yr (T11, minimal losses)
- **Total losses:** 21.4% (9.5% wake + 4.6% sector + 7.3% other)

### A.2.2 Vestas V162-6.2 @ 145m - Per-Turbine Breakdown

![Per-Turbine: Vestas V162-6.2 @ 145m](figures/per_turbine_V162-6.2_145m.png)

**Key observations:**
- **Wake pattern similar to N164:** Same turbines (7-9) experience highest wake losses, confirming layout-dependent wake effects
- **Sector losses identical:** Same turbines affected by sector management (layout-dependent, not turbine-type dependent)
- **Slightly more consistent:** Better match between hub height (145m) and rotor diameter (162m) reduces extreme variations
- **Total losses:** 21.2% (9.2% wake + 4.7% sector + 7.3% other)

### A.2.3 Vestas V162-6.2 @ 125m - Per-Turbine Breakdown

![Per-Turbine: Vestas V162-6.2 @ 125m](figures/per_turbine_V162-6.2_125m.png)

**Key observations:**
- **Hub height effect negligible:** 125m vs 145m hub height shows nearly identical production pattern
- **Same loss distribution:** Wake and sector losses match 145m configuration within 0.1%
- **Demonstrates height insensitivity:** For this flat terrain site, hub height variation (125-145m) has minimal impact
- **Total losses:** 21.2% (identical to 145m configuration)

### A.2.4 Vestas V163-4.5 @ 125m - Per-Turbine Breakdown

![Per-Turbine: Vestas V163-4.5 @ 125m](figures/per_turbine_V163-4.5_125m.png)

**Key observations:**
- **Reduced wake losses:** Turbines 7-9 show 18-24% wake loss (vs 20-28% for N164) - smaller turbines extract less power, allowing better downstream recovery
- **Higher capacity factors:** Many turbines individually exceed 40% CF due to optimal power rating for site wind speed distribution
- **Demonstrates wake recovery advantage:** Less aggressive power extraction by 4.5 MW turbines benefits downstream turbines
- **Total losses:** 20.6% (8.0% wake + 5.2% sector + 7.4% other) - lowest total losses among all configurations
