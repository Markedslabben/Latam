## Dominican Republic Wind Site - Turbine Selection Analysis

**Project:** Latam Hybrid Energy Analysis
**Location:** Dominican Republic (Lat: 19.72°N, Lon: 71.36°W)
**Analysis Period:** 2014-2025 (11.3 years)
**Date:** October 2025
**Wind Data Source:** Vortex ERA5 (164m hub height, hourly resolution)

# HOVEDBUDSKAP (Executive Summary)

The **Nordex N164 (7 MW) at 164m hub height** delivers the highest absolute annual energy production of **321.7 GWh/yr** with a capacity factor of 40.4% for the 13-turbine wind farm. However, when considering turbine-specific performance, the **Vestas V162-6.2 MW at 145m** achieves **96.1% of Nordex production** while offering potentially superior economics due to lower rated power (6.2 MW vs 7.0 MW).

The site demonstrates **excellent wind resources** with a mean wind speed of 7.35 m/s at 164m height, fitting a Weibull distribution with scale parameter A=8.27 m/s and shape parameter k=2.23. Analysis of three calculation methods (time series, Weibull distribution, and sector management) shows consistent results with the Weibull method providing conservative estimates approximately 8% lower than time series calculations.

**Key finding:** Sector management constraints (allowing only 60-120° and 240-300° wind directions) paradoxically increase calculated production by 23%, indicating these sectors experience significantly higher wind speeds - this requires validation with wake modeling and detailed site analysis.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with detailed wake analysis and economic comparison between Nordex N164 @ 164m and Vestas V162-6.2 @ 145m configurations.

# 1. ARGUMENTASJON (Arguments)

## 1.1 Site Wind Resource Characterization

### 1.1.1 Wind Speed Distribution

The 11.3-year dataset (99,000 hourly records from 2013-12-31 to 2025-04-17) reveals a robust wind resource at 164m hub height:

- **Mean wind speed:** 7.35 m/s
- **Weibull scale parameter (A):** 8.27 m/s
- **Weibull shape parameter (k):** 2.23
- **Mean from Weibull fit:** 7.33 m/s (0.33% difference from measured)

The excellent Weibull fit (Figure 1) with only 0.33% deviation between measured and theoretical mean validates using parametric methods for long-term energy predictions. The shape parameter k=2.23 indicates relatively consistent wind speeds with moderate variability, typical of trade wind influenced sites.

**Wind shear analysis** using Global Wind Atlas data determined a power law exponent α=0.1846, indicating moderately rough terrain with scattered obstacles. This coefficient enables accurate height adjustment from the 164m measurement level to alternative hub heights (125m and 145m).

### 1.1.2 Directional Distribution and Sector Management

Wind rose analysis (Figure: validation_wind_rose.png) reveals strong directional preferences:

- **Dominant sectors:** 60-120° (east-northeast to east-southeast) and 240-300° (west-southwest to west-northwest)
- **Sector retention:** 70.2% of all hourly records fall within allowed operational sectors
- **Mean wind speed in allowed sectors:** Significantly higher than omni-directional average (indicated by 23% AEP increase)

This directional concentration has critical implications for turbine spacing and wake management. The allowed sectors align with typical trade wind patterns in the Caribbean region.

### 1.1.3 Data Resolution Considerations

**Critical assessment:** The analysis uses **hourly-averaged Vortex ERA5 reanalysis data** (virtual measurements) rather than physical 10-minute measurements as specified by IEC 61400-12-1 standards.

**Impact on results:**

1. **Temporal smoothing:** Hourly averaging removes short-term turbulence and peak wind events that occur at sub-hourly timescales
2. **Power curve application:** IEC standards require 10-minute averages because power output responds non-linearly to wind speed variations
3. **Expected uncertainty:** Literature suggests hourly averaging can introduce **±2-5% uncertainty** in AEP estimates compared to 10-minute data (Measnet Site Assessment guidelines, IEC 61400-12-1)
4. **Direction:** Hourly averaging typically **underestimates** peak production during gusty conditions and **overestimates** during calm periods due to the cubic relationship between wind speed and power

**Quantitative assessment:**
- ERA5 reanalysis has known smoothing compared to mast measurements
- Studies show reanalysis data can underestimate extreme wind speeds by 5-10%
- For AEP calculations, the net effect is typically **conservative** (2-4% lower than actual)
- Results presented should be considered **best-estimate ranges** with ±5% uncertainty band

**Recommendation:** For final investment decision, validate with:
- Physical measurement campaign (12+ months) at proposed hub heights
- 10-minute averaging according to IEC 61400-12-1
- Concurrent measurements with ERA5 for correlation and bias correction

## 1.2 Turbine Performance Analysis

Three turbine models evaluated across five hub height configurations:

| Turbine Model | Rated Power | Rotor Diameter | Hub Heights Analyzed |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Nordex N164   | 7.0 MW      | 164 m          | 164 m               |
| Vestas V162-6.2 | 6.2 MW    | 162 m          | 125 m, 145 m        |
| Vestas V163-4.5 | 4.5 MW    | 163 m          | 125 m, 145 m        |

### 1.2.1 Time Series AEP Results (Table 1)

Direct application of measured hourly wind speeds to power curves yields:

**Best configurations (13-turbine farm):**

1. **Nordex N164 @ 164m:** 321.7 GWh/yr (40.4% CF, 3,535 FLH)
2. **V162-6.2 @ 145m:** 309.2 GWh/yr (43.8% CF, 3,836 FLH) - **96.1% of Nordex**
3. **V162-6.2 @ 125m:** 294.2 GWh/yr (41.7% CF, 3,651 FLH) - **91.5% of Nordex**

**Key observations:**
- Nordex N164 benefits from highest hub height (164m vs 145m/125m) accessing stronger winds
- V162-6.2 achieves higher capacity factor (43.8%) than Nordex (40.4%) at 145m due to better matching between rated power and wind distribution
- V163-4.5 configurations show highest capacity factors (49.6-51.5%) but lowest absolute production due to smaller rated power

**Normalized difference analysis:**
- At 125m: V162-6.2 produces **12.5%** more than V163-4.5 (normalized difference: +0.125)
- At 145m: V162-6.2 produces **14.1%** more than V163-4.5 (normalized difference: +0.141)

This demonstrates clear advantage of the higher rated power V162-6.2 for this wind regime.

### 1.2.2 Weibull AEP Results (Table 2)

Using fitted Weibull distribution (A=8.27, k=2.23) provides parametric AEP estimates:

**Results (13-turbine farm):**

1. **Nordex N164 @ 164m:** 296.8 GWh/yr (37.2% CF, 3,262 FLH)
2. **V162-6.2 @ 145m:** 282.2 GWh/yr (40.0% CF, 3,501 FLH) - **95.1% of Nordex**
3. **V162-6.2 @ 125m:** 268.6 GWh/yr (38.0% CF, 3,333 FLH) - **90.5% of Nordex**

**Weibull vs Time Series comparison:**
- Weibull method gives **8.0% lower AEP** than time series (321.7 → 296.8 GWh/yr for Nordex)
- Difference attributed to Weibull smoothing of actual wind speed distribution
- Weibull provides **conservative planning estimate**
- Time series captures actual temporal variations

**Recommendation:** Use time series results for detailed modeling, Weibull for sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification.

### 1.2.3 Sector Management Impact (Table 3)

Restricting operation to 60-120° and 240-300° sectors (70.2% data retention):

**Results (13-turbine farm):**

1. **Nordex N164 @ 164m:** 397.1 GWh/yr (49.8% CF, 4,363 FLH)
2. **V162-6.2 @ 145m:** 381.7 GWh/yr (54.1% CF, 4,736 FLH) - **96.1% of Nordex**
3. **V162-6.2 @ 125m:** 364.2 GWh/yr (51.6% CF, 4,519 FLH) - **91.7% of Nordex**

**Critical finding:** Sector management **increases** calculated AEP by **23.4%** (321.7 → 397.1 GWh/yr).

**Interpretation:**
- Allowed sectors (60-120°, 240-300°) have substantially **higher mean wind speeds** than omitted sectors
- This is physically plausible for sites with strong directional preferences (trade winds)
- **However:** This analysis assumes **zero wake losses** - unrealistic for 13-turbine farm
- **Reality:** Sector management reduces wake losses but the **net effect** depends on turbine spacing and layout

**Action required:**
- Perform full wake modeling (PyWake with NOJ or Bastankhah-Gaussian deficit models)
- Compare scenarios: omni-directional vs sector-managed operation
- Validate that production increase exceeds losses from directional restrictions

## 1.3 Comparative Performance Metrics

### 1.3.1 Hub Height Sensitivity

**Impact of 20m height increase (125m → 145m):**

| Turbine | AEP Increase | CF Increase | Mechanism |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| V162-6.2 | +5.1% | +2.1 pp | Higher winds, better power curve matching |
| V163-4.5 | +3.9% | +1.9 pp | Higher winds, already high CF at 125m |

**Wind shear relationship:**
Using α=0.1846, wind speed increases from 6.99 m/s @ 125m to 7.19 m/s @ 145m (+2.8%).

The **non-linear power response** amplifies this 2.8% wind speed increase to 4-5% energy gain, demonstrating value of increased hub height.

### 1.3.2 Capacity Factor Analysis

**Capacity factor hierarchy:**

1. V163-4.5 @ 145m: **51.5%** (highest CF, but lowest rated power limits total production)
2. V163-4.5 @ 125m: **49.6%**
3. V162-6.2 @ 145m: **43.8%** (excellent balance of CF and rated power)
4. V162-6.2 @ 125m: **41.7%**
5. Nordex N164 @ 164m: **40.4%** (lower CF due to 7 MW rating, but highest absolute production)

**Interpretation:**
- Higher rated power → lower CF for same wind regime
- CF alone is **misleading** for turbine selection
- **Energy output** (GWh/yr) and **economics** (€/MWh) are decision criteria

### 1.3.3 Technology Comparison: V162-6.2 vs V163-4.5

**At 125m hub height (normalized difference: +0.125):**
- V162-6.2 produces **12.5% more energy** than V163-4.5
- Both turbines have similar rotor diameters (162m vs 163m)
- Difference attributable to **rated power** (6.2 MW vs 4.5 MW)
- Site wind distribution has sufficient high-speed hours to utilize 6.2 MW capacity

**At 145m hub height (normalized difference: +0.141):**
- V162-6.2 advantage increases to **14.1%**
- Higher winds at 145m favor higher rated power turbines
- Confirms V162-6.2 as better match for this wind regime

**Economic consideration:** If V163-4.5 CAPEX is significantly lower (>15%), it may remain competitive despite lower production.

## 2.2 Statistical Analysis

### 2.2.1 Weibull Distribution Fitting

**Method:** Maximum Likelihood Estimation (scipy.stats.weibull_min.fit)

**Parameters:**
- Location parameter fixed at 0 (floc=0)
- Shape parameter (k) optimized: **2.226**
- Scale parameter (A) optimized: **8.272 m/s**

**Mean wind speed from Weibull:**

$$\bar{V} = A \times \Gamma\left(1 + \frac{1}{k}\right)$$

Where Γ is the gamma function.

$$\bar{V} = 8.272 \times \Gamma\left(1 + \frac{1}{2.226}\right) = 7.326 \text{ m/s}$$

**Fit quality:**
- Measured mean: 7.350 m/s

- **Difference: 0.33%** (excellent agreement)

**Probability density function:**

$$f(v) = \frac{k}{A} \left(\frac{v}{A}\right)^{k-1} \exp\left[-\left(\frac{v}{A}\right)^k\right]$$

**Application:** Used for Weibull-based AEP calculations (Table 2) and long-term wind speed probability estimation.

### 2.2.2 AEP Calculation Methods

**Method 1: Time Series AEP (Table 1)**

For each hourly record:
1. Adjust wind speed to hub height using power law
2. Interpolate power from turbine power curve
3. Sum hourly power values → total energy over 11.3 years
4. Divide by 11.3 to get average annual energy (1 turbine)
5. Multiply by 13 turbines

**Equation:**

$$AEP = \frac{1}{N_{years}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{hours}} P(V_i) \times N_{turbines}$$

**Method 2: Weibull AEP (Table 2)**

1. Fit Weibull to adjusted wind speeds at each hub height
2. Calculate expected power using continuous integration:

$$\bar{P} = \int_0^{\infty} P(v) \times f_{Weibull}(v) \, dv$$

3. Annual energy = $\bar{P}$ × 8,760 hours × 13 turbines

**Numerical integration:** Trapezoidal rule with 0.1 m/s wind speed bins (0-30 m/s).

**Method 3: Sector Management AEP (Table 3)**

1. Filter time series to allowed sectors (60-120° and 240-300°)
2. Apply Method 1 to filtered dataset
3. Annualize based on actual data retention (70.2%)

**Note:** No wake modeling applied in any method - results represent **gross AEP** before wake losses.

### 2.5.3 Quality Assurance

**Validation checks:**
- ✅ Data continuity (no gaps in 99,000-record time series)
- ✅ Weibull fit quality (0.33% mean deviation)
- ✅ Shear profile accuracy (R² = 0.9995)
- ✅ Power curve interpolation (linear, monotonic)
- ✅ Energy conservation (sum of hourly production matches annual)

**Cross-checks:**
- Capacity factor range: 37-63% (physically plausible for wind farm)
- Full load hours: 3,262-5,504 (consistent with capacity factors)
- AEP scaling: Linear with number of turbines (validated)
- Normalized differences: Consistent across all three methods (±0.01)

# 3. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

## 3.1 Key Findings Summary

1. **Site Quality:** Excellent wind resource (7.35 m/s @ 164m, A=8.27 m/s, k=2.23)

2. **Best Absolute Production:** Nordex N164 @ 164m - **321.7 GWh/yr** (40.4% CF)

3. **Best Alternative:** Vestas V162-6.2 @ 145m - **309.2 GWh/yr** (43.8% CF, 96.1% of Nordex)

4. **Technology Comparison:** V162-6.2 produces **12-14% more** than V163-4.5 at same hub heights

5. **Method Consistency:** Time series, Weibull, and sector management show consistent normalized rankings

6. **Data Uncertainty:** ±6-10% due to hourly averaging and ERA5 reanalysis limitations

## 3.2 Decision Framework

**Proceed to detailed analysis:**
- [ ] PyWake wake modeling (NOJ and Bastankhah-Gaussian models)
- [ ] Turbine layout optimization for sector management
- [ ] Economic analysis (LCOE comparison: N164 vs V162-6.2)
- [ ] Grid connection and curtailment assessment

**Risk mitigation:**
- [ ] 12-month measurement campaign at 125m, 145m, and 164m
- [ ] 10-minute averaging per IEC 61400-12-1
- [ ] Correlation with ERA5 for bias correction
- [ ] Sodar/Lidar profiling for shear validation

**Sensitivity analysis required:**
- [ ] Wake loss scenarios (5-15% range)
- [ ] Sector management net impact
- [ ] Long-term wind speed variability (P50/P90)
- [ ] Turbine availability and performance degradation

## 3.3 Next Steps

**Phase 1: Immediate (0-3 months)**
1. Deploy measurement mast or Lidar at site
2. Run PyWake simulations for 13-turbine layout
3. Obtain firm turbine pricing from Nordex and Vestas
4. Conduct preliminary grid connection study

**Phase 2: Pre-construction (3-15 months)**
1. Complete 12-month measurement campaign
2. Finalize turbine selection based on LCOE
3. Optimize layout for wake minimization
4. Secure grid connection agreement

**Phase 3: Financial Close (15-18 months)**
1. Independent technical due diligence
2. Energy yield assessment (P50/P90/P99)
3. Finalize EPC contracts
4. Financial modeling and investment decision

**Dataset:** vortex.serie.850689.10y 164m UTC-04.0 ERA5.txt

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Total records** | 99,000 hours |
| **Period** | 2013-12-31 to 2025-04-17 |
| **Duration** | 11.3 years |
| **Mean wind speed** | 7.35 m/s |
| **Standard deviation** | 3.42 m/s |
| **Maximum wind speed** | 23.8 m/s |
| **Minimum wind speed** | 0.1 m/s |

| **Fit error** | 0.33% |

## Appendix B: Hub Height Wind Speed Adjustments

**Shear coefficient:** α = 0.1846 (Global Wind Atlas)

| Hub Height | Mean WS | Std Dev | Max WS | Weibull A | Weibull k |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 164 m | 7.35 m/s | 3.42 m/s | 23.8 m/s | 8.272 | 2.226 |
| 145 m | 7.19 m/s | 3.34 m/s | 23.3 m/s | 8.092 | 2.226 |
| 125 m | 6.99 m/s | 3.25 m/s | 22.6 m/s | 7.866 | 2.226 |

**Note:** Weibull k assumed constant across heights (standard practice for moderate height differences).

## Appendix C: Sector Management Wind Speed Analysis

**Allowed sectors:** 60-120° and 240-300°

| Metric | All Directions | Allowed Sectors | Difference |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Records** | 99,000 | 69,467 | 70.2% retained |
| **Mean wind speed** | 7.35 m/s | 8.14 m/s | **+10.7%** |
| **Weibull A** | 8.27 m/s | 9.16 m/s | **+10.8%** |
| **Weibull k** | 2.226 | 2.189 | -1.7% |

**Interpretation:** Allowed sectors have significantly higher wind speeds, explaining the 23% AEP increase. This directional bias is common in trade wind regions but requires wake modeling validation.

## Appendix D: Uncertainty Budget

|--------|----------------------|----------|
| **ERA5 reanalysis bias** | ±3-5% | Hourly averaging and model smoothing |
| **Weibull fit** | ±3% | Excellent fit quality (0.33% mean error) |
| **Power curve** | ±2% | Manufacturer tolerances, air density |
| **Shear coefficient** | ±2% | R²=0.9995 fit quality |
| **Temporal sampling** | ±2-3% | 11.3 years sufficient for stability |
| **Wake losses** | Not included | Requires PyWake modeling |
| **Availability** | Not included | Assume 97-98% per IEC standards |
| **Grid curtailment** | Not included | Site-specific assessment |
| **Combined (RSS)** | **±6-10%** | Root sum square of independent errors |

**Recommendation:** Report P50 ± 10% for feasibility range. Refine with physical measurements for P90/P99 estimates.
