The first section after the summary should include figure1_wind_distribution_power_curves.png,  where both wind distributions and power curves are shown, and comment on the suitability of turbines for the site.  

Performance comparison (most important should perhaps come first and the table should also be listed in the hovedbudskap - table4
Table 4 contains all the turbine (as rows) , and the columns should contain: 
Configuration,Rated Power (MW),Hub Height (m),NET AEP (GWh/yr),Total Loss (%),Capacity Factor (%),Full Load Hours (hr/yr) and Normalised production.   is just the NEet AEP for each configuration divided on the N163 configuration so that the turbine production becomes a relative measure.  Finally a last column should contain the difference in normal production on thecorresponding row of Vestass 6.2 MW and Vestas 4.5 MW for 145 m hub height, and similarly for Vestas 6.2 125m hub hegiht the diffrence between 6.2 and 4.5 MW production, by calculated the differences in normalisedf production (which then becomes the % difference)
So update table 4 to accomodate this.  

Tjn the per turbine production should be shown, for the Vestas 4.5 MW 145m turbine, while the other similar figures are left for appendix (should be for all turbines in 4 subplots. 
make sure also each loss component are labelled on the stack bar per turbine.  C:\Users\klaus\klauspython\Latam\PowerCurve_analysis\figures\per_turbine_V163-4.5_145m.png is the reference here to show.  Now 

Section 2 should comment on the weibull distribution vs histogram The wind distributions in terms of historgrams (most correct), and weibull fit should be commented, whereas the weibull fit and goodnes of fit are commented and details left for appendix wind conditions, including weibull fit, height extrapolation using shear, and descriptbion of vortex data, plus stas.  Moreover the relevance of histogram from simulated Vortex data vs weibull fit vs also only including the rlevant sectors or wind conditions producting for the weibull fit, confer also the sector management.  The wind nrose shoudl be plottetd .  Now the figure v alidation_wind_rose is lacking circles the polar coordinates i.e the radial axis) and should also contain angle axis.  

Then ther eshould be a seciton about the overall method, using pywake, using time series, using bashthanka wake model, calculating losses and describing the sector management approach as well as turbine spacing . details are left for appendix, so details should b e left there. THe appendix should be detailed enough to documen tthe input parameters for the simulations, and the type of models used. plus the previously mentioned wind data analysis. stress also that no flow model has been used at this stage. justified by flat terrain and lack of physical measurements.
