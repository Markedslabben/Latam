# Test LaTeX Equations

This is a test document with inline equations like $E = mc^2$ and $\alpha = 0.1846$.

## 1.1 Wind Speed Distribution

The Weibull distribution has parameters $A = 8.27$ m/s and shape parameter $k = 2.23$.

The mean wind speed is calculated as: $\bar{v} = 7.35$ m/s.

Power law equation: $v_2 = v_1 \left(\frac{h_2}{h_1}\right)^\alpha$

### 1.1.1 More Complex Equations

Fraction test: $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$

Square root: $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$

## 1.2 Another Section

This should become "Another Section" without "1.2" in the Word document.
