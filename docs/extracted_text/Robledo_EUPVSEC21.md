Dynamic simulation of the shading cast by a wind farm
on an adjacent photovoltaic plant

## Purpose of the work

In the case of hybridization between a wind farm and an adjacent solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant, the
wind farm can cast shadows on the nearby PV generators. The rotation of long blades in the nearby area of
the modules induces dynamic disturbances during short periods of time that can have a significant impact on
the PV generation, while being difficult to evaluate on a yearly basis. The current state-of-the-art PV
simulation tools cannot easily handle this kind of dynamic shading problems, hence simplified models are
often used. Depending on the simplifications chosen to evaluate the shading impacts, significant differences
can be observed in the resulting shadow flicker area. Simple hypotheses are often chosen for their
conservative character, but they often turn out to be overly pessimistic and of little practical use. Therefore, a
more accurate and realistic approach is necessary.

## Methodology

The shading losses impacting the photovoltaic (PV) generators are evaluated with a novel advanced 3D
shading simulation tool using dynamic visualization based on the power of modern GPUs (Graphic Processor
Unit). This approach has been successfully applied to other studies [1] with complex shading systems or
moving objects because it can provide accurate results while maintaining relatively low computation times,
which is beneficial in the context of commercial studies.

## Case study

This study evaluates the shading losses impacting a hybrid wind/PV park in a sunny region. The simulation
considered the following steps:

## 1 - Ground shading analysis

## Shadow flicker – Unknown wind heading

## Shadow flicker – Usual approach

Shadow flicker – Improved approach with dynamic
rotation of blades simulation

2 – Evaluation of shading losses as a function of relative position to wind turbine

## Shading losses comparison

Shading losses evaluation vs distance to wind turbine

Heat map (2D) of shading losses respect to
wind turbines

3 – Creation of a cost function to identify the preference of trackers installation
