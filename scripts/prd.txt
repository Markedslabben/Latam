Project: Latam Hybrid Wind-Solar Power Plant
Description: Development of a hybrid power generation facility combining wind and solar power with potential battery storage system (BESS) integration.

Project Overview:
- Total Wind Capacity: 50 MW (Expected generation: 180 GWh/year)
- Total Solar Capacity: 132 MW (Expected generation: 200 GWh/year)
- Location: Dominican Republic (to be confirmed)
- Grid Integration: Subject to limitations (requires assessment)

Key Requirements:

1. Wind Power Development
   - Acquire and analyze high-resolution terrain data using QGIS and Rhino
   - Obtain and process wind data:
     * ERA5 hourly data (31km resolution, 100m hub height)
     * Vortex Mast service data (100m resolution)
   - Validate wind statistics against Global Wind Atlas
   - Optimize turbine layout considering:
     * Site boundaries
     * Inter-turbine spacing
     * Wake effects using NREL toolbox or parkoptimizer
   - Select and implement Nordex 6.x wind turbines
   - Design crane pads (27.5m x 40m) and access infrastructure

2. Solar PV Integration
   - Perform GIS-based analysis for viable PV zones
   - Account for wind turbine shadow effects:
     * Tower shadows
     * Rotor sweep area impacts
   - Optimize PV block layout
   - Design access roads and infrastructure

3. Production Analysis
   - Generate hourly production estimates:
     * Wind power P50 including wake losses
     * Solar PV generation
   - Analyze hourly price data
   - Calculate revenue projections
   - Consider turbine self-consumption (1-1.5%)

4. Electrical Infrastructure
   - Design 690V/22kV substations for turbines
   - Plan main substation layout
   - Assess grid connection limitations
   - Evaluate BESS integration:
     * Size optimization
     * Charge/discharge constraints
     * Cost-benefit analysis

5. System Integration
   - Create comprehensive site layout
   - Optimize hybrid system operation
   - Design control and monitoring systems
   - Ensure compliance with grid requirements

Technical Constraints:
